# Exercise 6: Improve database security posture with Data Discovery and Classification and Microsoft Defender for SQL

### Estimated Duration: 30 minutes

## Overview

In this lab, you'll set up some of the advanced security features of SQL MI and explore some of the security benefits that come with running your database in Azure. [Microsoft Defender for SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/azure-defender-for-sql) provides advanced SQL security capabilities, including functionality for surfacing and mitigating potential database vulnerabilities and detecting anomalous activities that could indicate a threat to your database. Also, [Data Discovery and Classification](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/data-discovery-and-classification-overview) allows you to discover and classify sensitive data within the database.

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will perform the following:

- Task 1: Configure Data Discovery and Classification
- Task 2: Review an Microsoft Defender for SQL Vulnerability Assessment

### Task 1: Configure Data Discovery and Classification

In this task, you review the [Data Discovery and Classification](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/data-discovery-and-classification-overview) feature of Azure SQL. Data Discovery & Classification introduces a new tool for discovering, classifying, labelling, and reporting the sensitive data in your databases. It introduces a set of advanced services, forming a new SQL Information Protection paradigm aimed at protecting the data in your database, not just the database. Discovering and classifying your most sensitive data (e.g., business, financial, healthcare) can play a pivotal role in your organizational information protection stature.

1. Navigate to **SQLMI-Shared-RG** resource group and select the SQL Managed instance named **sqlmi--cus**. Now, from the **Overview** tab search and select the Managed database named **WideWorldImporters<inject key="Suffix" enableCopy="false"/>**.

    ![](media/New-image62.png)
   
1. On the **WideWorldImporters<inject key="Suffix" enableCopy="false"/>** Managed database blade, select **Data Discovery & Classification** from the left-hand menu.

   ![](media/new-image64.png)

1. In the **Data Discovery & Classification** blade, select the info link with the message **Currently database is using SQL Information Protection policy. Found 35 columns with classification recommendations**.

   ![](media/new-image65.png)

1. Look over the list of recommendations to get a better understanding of the types of data and classifications that can be assigned, based on the built-in classification settings. In the list of classification recommendations, select the recommendation for the **Sales - CreditCard - CardNumber** field.

   ![The CreditCard number recommendation is highlighted in the recommendations list.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-recommendations-credit-card.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

1. Due to the risk of exposing credit card information, WWI would like a way to classify it as highly confidential, not just **Confidential**, as the recommendation suggests. To correct this, select **+ Add classification** at the top of the Data Discovery & Classification blade.

   ![](media/new-image66.png)

1. Expand the **Sensitivity label** field and review the various built-in labels from which you can choose. You can also add custom labels, should you desire.

   ![](media/new-image67.png)

1. In the Add classification dialog, enter the following and then select **Add classification**.

   - **Schema name**: Select **Sales**.
   - **Table name**: Select **CreditCard**.
   - **Column name**: Select **CardNumber (nvarchar)**.
   - **Information type**: Select **Credit Card**.
   - **Sensitivity level**: Select **Highly Confidential**.

      ![](media/new-image68.png)

1. Notice that the **Sales - CreditCard - CardNumber** field disappears from the recommendations list, and the number of recommendations drops by 1.

1. Select **Save** on the toolbar of the Data Classification window.

   ![](media/new-image69.png)

1. Other recommendations you can review are the **HumanResources - Employee** fields for **NationIDNumber** and **BirthDate**. Note that the recommendation service flagged these fields as **Confidential - GDPR**. WWI maintains data about gamers from around the world, including Europe, so having a tool that helps them discover data that may be relevant to GDPR compliance is very helpful.

    ![GDPR information is highlighted in the list of recommendations](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-recommendations-gdpr.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

1. Check the **Select all** checkbox at the top of the list to select all the remaining recommended classifications, and then select **Accept selected recommendations**.

    ![](media/new-image70.png)

1. Select **Save** on the toolbar of the Data Classification window. It may take several minutes for the save to complete.

    ![Save the updates to the classified columns list.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-save.png "Save")

1. When the save completes, select the **Overview** tab on the Data Discovery & Classification blade to view a report with a full summary of the database classification state.

    ![The View Report button is highlighted on the toolbar.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-overview-report.png "View report")

   ![The Vulnerability Assessment dashboard is displayed.](media/sql-mi-vulnerability-assessment-dashboard1.png "Vulnerability Assessment dashboard")

1. In the scan results, take a few minutes to browse both the Failed and Passed checks, and review the types of checks that are performed. In the **Unhealthy** list, locate the security check for **Transparent data encryption**. This check has an ID of **VA1219**.

   ![The VA1219 finding for Transparent data encryption is highlighted.](media/sql-mi-vulnerability-assessment-failed-va1219.png "Vulnerability assessment")

   >**Note**: If changes do not appear immediately, kindly refresh the page.

1. Select the **VA1219** finding to view the detailed description.

   ![The details of the VA1219 - Transparent data encryption should be enabled finding are displayed with the description, impact, and remediation fields highlighted.](media/sql-mi-vulnerability-assessment-failed-va1219-details1.png "Vulnerability Assessment")

   > The details for each finding provide more insight into the reason for the finding. Of note are fields describing the finding, the impact of the recommended settings, and details on remediation for the finding.

1. You will now act on the recommended remediation steps for the finding and enable [Transparent Data Encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/transparent-data-encryption-tde-overview?tabs=azure-portal) for the `WideWorldImporters` database. To accomplish this, switch over to using SSMS on your JumpBox VM for the next few steps.

     > **Note**: Transparent data encryption (TDE) needs to be manually enabled for Azure SQL Managed Instance. TDE helps protect Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Data Warehouse against the threat of malicious activity. It performs real-time encryption and decryption of the database, associated backups, and transaction log files at rest without requiring changes to the application.

1. Navigate to **sql2022-<inject key="Suffix" enableCopy="false"/>** Virtual Machine

1. Back to **SQL Server Management Studio 20** from the Start menu, enter the following information in the **Connect to Server** dialogue and click on **Connect(6)**.

   >**Note**: If you have not connected to **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17** in the previous step, follow the steps below. Otherwise, proceed to the next 
      step.

   - **Server name** **(1)**: Enter the fully qualified domain name of your SQL-managed instance, which you copied from the Azure Cloud Shell in a previous task.
   - **Authentication** **(2)**: Select **SQL Server Authentication**.
   - **Login** **(3)**: Enter `contosoadmin`
   - **Password** **(4)**: Enter `IAE5fAijit0w^rDM`

      ![](media/new-image42.png)

1. In SSMS, select **New Query** from the toolbar and paste the following SQL script into the new query window.

   > **Note**: Make sure to replace the **{Managed-database-Name}** with **WideWorldImporters<inject key="Suffix" enableCopy="false"/>**.

   ```SQL
   USE {Managed-database-Name};
   GO

   ALTER DATABASE [{Managed-database-Name}] SET ENCRYPTION ON
   ```

   > You turn transparent data encryption on and off on the database level. To enable transparent data encryption on a database in Azure SQL Managed Instance use must use T-SQL.

      ![The query above is pasted into a new query window in SSMS.](media/create-quary.png "New query")

1. Select **Execute** from the SSMS toolbar. After a few seconds, you will see a message that **Commands completed successfully**. 

    ![The query above is pasted into a new query window in SSMS.](media/create-quary-execute.png "New query")

10. You can verify the encryption state and view information on the associated encryption keys by using the [sys.dm_database_encryption_keys view](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-database-encryption-keys-transact-sql). Select **New Query** on the SSMS toolbar again, and paste the following query into the new query window:
